By [Vlad Stirbu](https://github.com/vstirbu).

Adds ability to share the content of a canvas element to Instagram.

### Installing the pluggin to your project

The simplest way to install the plugin is via the [pluginstall](http://github.com/alunny/pluginstall) tool.

If you prefer to install the plugin manually, copy the content of the src/ios folder in the Plugins directory and the content of the www folder in your www folder. Add the plugin to your Cordova.plist, in Plugins section: the key is ```Instagram``` and value is ```CDVInstagramPlugin```.

### Instagram plugin JavaScript API

Detect if the Instagram application is installed on the device. The function isInstalled accepts a callback function as parameter:

```javascript
Instagram.isInstalled(function (err, installed) {
    if (installed) {
        console.log("Instagram is installed");
    } else {
        console.log("Instagram is not installed");
    }
});
```

Share the content of a canvas element. The function share accepts the canvas element id and a callback function as parameters:

```javascript
Instagram.share(canvasId, function (err) {
    if (err) {
        console.log("not shared");
    } else {
        console.log("shared");
    }
});
```
